I prefer getting to know my tenant and developing a relationships from there. In this way, they are open to speaking to me if there is a challenge they are facing (all professionally of course) and then we can find common ground on how to fix it. I find this method also helps when it comes to lease matters and such, for example, where you will not get a tenant who just ups and leaves without notice. For other matters as well, should something happen to Avery, I would need to know and understand who to contact or if they have an episode, how to handle them in that moment and not just treat it as a random happening.",
